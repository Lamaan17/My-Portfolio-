# Welcome to My-Portfolio!
This is a collection of my data projects, ranging from using PowerBI, R, SQL, and Python (oh and Excel)
I've got the good, the bad, and the average here, a good overview of how I've attempted to grow (and plan to continue to do so) in Data Science as a whole. 

This repo showcases my data projects using Excel, SQL, Power BI, R, and Python.
